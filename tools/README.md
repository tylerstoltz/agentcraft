# tools/

Windows PowerShell 5.1+ and Node 22. `launch.ps1` installs the npm dependencies it needs on the
first run (`npm ci` in `foreman/` and `tools/`); the Gradle wrapper downloads Gradle, Minecraft
and Fabric by itself. Java 25 must be installed (Temurin 25: https://adoptium.net).

## Daily use

```powershell
tools\launch.ps1                              # claude backend, state in ~/.agentcraft, Foreman :7878, DevBridge :7879
tools\launch.ps1 -Repo C:\code\life-tracker   # also register a repo with the Foreman
tools\launch.ps1 -Backend sim                 # scripted demo team (no API calls), demo repo in sandbox/
tools\launch.ps1 -Showcase                    # static showcase state (sim); -Showcase late for the later one
tools\stop.ps1                                # stop what launch.ps1 started (game + Foreman)
tools\stop.ps1 -Game                          # just the game: agents keep working, relaunch any time
```

From `cmd.exe` or Explorer: `tools\launch.cmd` / `tools\stop.cmd` (same arguments).

`launch.ps1`:
1. Reuses a running Foreman for `<home>/<profile>` (its `foreman.json` pid alive + port answering),
   otherwise starts one in the background (hidden console; log `artifacts\logs\foreman-<profile>.log`).
2. Builds if needed and starts Minecraft (`gradlew runClient`, `GRADLE_USER_HOME` =
   `<repo>\.gradle-home`), passing `AGENTCRAFT_PORT`, `AGENTCRAFT_DEV_PORT`, `AGENTCRAFT_HOME`,
   `AGENTCRAFT_PROFILE`, `AGENTCRAFT_MUTE=0`, `AGENTCRAFT_FOCUS=1` to the game. Log: `artifacts\logs\game.log`.
3. Waits until the HQ world is ready and prints what runs where and how to stop it.

If the game of this checkout is already running it is reused (one client per checkout: they share
`mod/run`). Quitting the game window leaves the Foreman running (agents keep working); the next
`launch.ps1` reuses it.

| parameter | default | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-Backend sim\|claude` | `claude` (`AGENTCRAFT_BACKEND`) | `-Showcase` implies `sim` |
| `-Repo <path>[,<path>]` | | registered at start, or sent as `repo.add` to a running Foreman |
| `-Profile <name>` | backend name; `showcase` / `showcase-late` | state lives in `<home>/<profile>` |
| `-Showcase [busy\|late]` | | hold a static scripted state (QA screenshots); always a fresh (`--reset`) profile |
| `-Home <dir>` | `~/.agentcraft` (`AGENTCRAFT_HOME`); with `-Dev`: `<main checkout>\.agentcraft-home` | **QA/tests must pass the project home** |
| `-Port N` / `-DevPort N` | 7878 / 7879 (`AGENTCRAFT_PORT` / `AGENTCRAFT_DEV_PORT`) | 3000/5173/8080 are refused |
| `-Dev` | | unattended runs: muted, never steals focus, no toasts, Gradle daemon exits after 30 idle min |
| `-Reset` | | wipe the profile before starting (new Foreman only) |
| `-Speed x`, `-Autostart`, `-Goal "..."` | | sim speed / start the scripted goal / submit a goal at start |
| `-ForemanArgs @('--workers','kit,wren')` | | extra Foreman flags (`npm run start -- --help`) |
| `-Notify` / `-NoNotify` | Foreman default (on for claude) | Windows toasts |
| `-NoGame`, `-NoForeman`, `-NoWait` | | only the Foreman / only the game / don't wait for the world |
| `-GradleHome <dir>` | `GRADLE_USER_HOME` or `<main checkout>\.gradle-home` | |
| `-TimeoutSec N` | 600 | how long to wait for the world |
| `-SummaryJson <file>` | | machine-readable result (what was started or reused, pids, ports, logs) |
| `-DryRun` | | print the Foreman command, the game command and the game env; start nothing |

`stop.ps1` stops only what `launch.ps1` started, using the run files in `artifacts\run\`
(pid + process start time, so a reused pid is never touched): the game via the DevBridge
`dev.quit` (world saved), the Foreman via Ctrl+Break into its hidden console (the Foreman saves
its state and releases `foreman.json`, like Ctrl+C in a terminal), then, after `-TimeoutSec`
(30), a force-kill of only those process trees. A Foreman that `launch.ps1` reused but did not
start is left alone. `-Game` / `-Foreman` / `-Profile` / `-Home` / `-Port` narrow it down;
`-FromSummary <launch summary>` stops exactly what one launch started; `-StopDaemon` also stops
this checkout's Gradle daemon (never another checkout's).

## Dev / QA tools

```powershell
node tools/devcli.mjs state --port 7889                 # DevBridge CLI (mod/DEV.md has the full command list)
node tools/foremancli.mjs status --port 27878           # Foreman: backend/auth, agents, tasks, open decisions
node tools/foremancli.mjs diff --decision d3 --port 27878
node tools/foremancli.mjs send user.message to=kit "text=hi there" --port 27878   # any client message, prints the ack
node tools/shoot.mjs tools/scenes/qa.json --only qa01_exterior_hero --port 7889 --foreman 27878 --prefix wip/
node tools/qa.mjs --port 27878 --dev-port 7889 --home C:\Projects\agentcraft\.agentcraft-home
node tools/record.mjs tools/shots/desk_story.json --port 7889 --hold 3000   # play a camera shot for OBS (shots/README.md)
